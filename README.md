# Cue-2

## Cross-platform show control and playback
Cue-2 offers a reliable and fast way to build sound, video and show control.

## Features
- Audio and video playback (wide format support via FFmpeg)
- OSC send/receive
- Text overlays, cue library, session management
- Low-latency cue triggering

## Free and Open Source
Forever

## Dependencies & Licensing
- **Godot Engine** (MIT)
- **FFmpeg** (LGPLv2.1 or later) — see [docs/FFmpeg-Licensing.md](docs/FFmpeg-Licensing.md) and https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html
- **SDL3** (zlib)
- **FFmpeg.AutoGen** (MIT)
- **SDL3-CS** (zlib)
- **RtMidi** (MIT-style) — MIDI device I/O; natives in `bin/`

**Important (FFmpeg compliance):**  
Cue2 uses FFmpeg libraries under the LGPLv2.1 via dynamic loading.  
The corresponding source code for the FFmpeg version used to build the bundled libraries is available as described in the documentation and GitHub Releases.

Attribution is shown in the in-app About dialog.

## Installation & Building
See the project wiki or `src/proposed_README.md` for build instructions.

## Export packaging
Godot export does **not** embed FFmpeg or RtMidi as loadable OS libraries. Every shipping build is **export → copy natives → platform-sign**.

| Platform | Runbook |
|----------|---------|
| All (what ships, layouts) | [docs/export-packaging.md](docs/export-packaging.md) |
| GitHub Releases / in-app updater | [docs/github-releases.md](docs/github-releases.md) |
| **macOS** (FFmpeg + Developer ID + notarize + zip) | [docs/macos-codesign.md](docs/macos-codesign.md) |
| Windows (Authenticode / SmartScreen) | [docs/windows-codesign.md](docs/windows-codesign.md) |
| FFmpeg license + portable macOS build | [docs/FFmpeg-Licensing.md](docs/FFmpeg-Licensing.md) |

Do **not** use Godot’s built-in macOS notarization — it runs before FFmpeg/RtMidi are copied. Rebuild MIDI natives with `python tools/build-rtmidi-natives.py` only when those binaries change.

## Platforms
Cue-2 targets:
- Windows 10+
